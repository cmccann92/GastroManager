# Gastro Manager


### The Goal

Gastromanager is a backend system to help easily manage all the administrative and day-to-day tasks of a restaurant, cafe, ice cream shop, etc. Dramatically cutting down the time needed to do these things in so giving a huge cost savings.

### Where we are now 

We have started by custom building it for one shop in particular in our case an ice cream shop "Green Scoop". This has been critical for understanding the kind of things a small business needs and understanding how to implement that.

In future the goal is in making it more general purpose for use in other enterprises so it can be sold as a service
